# Inverse Euler equations to solve multidimensional discrete-continuous dynamic models
Repository for `Using inverse Euler equations to solve multidimensional discrete-continuous dynamic models: A general method'

We develop a general inverse Euler equation method to efficiently solve any multidimensional stochastic dynamic optimization problem with agents facing discrete-continuous choices and occasionally binding constraints. First, we provide a discrete time analogue to the Hamiltonian to (painlessly) recover the generalized necessary Euler equation. We then establish necessary and sufficient conditions to determine the existence of an Euler equation inverse, and the structure of the exogenous computational grid on which the inverse is well-defined. To handle applications with non-convexities generated by discrete choices, we finally present an off-the-shelf `rooftop-cut' algorithm guaranteed to asymptotically recover the optimal policy function under standard economic assumptions. We demonstrate our approach using two workhorse applications in the literature, and document the computational speed and accuracy gains our method generates.
